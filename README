Equations - A plugin for dependent pattern-matching
===================================================
Copyright 2009-2010 Matthieu Sozeau <mattam@mattam.org>

To compile equations, simply run [coq_makefile -f Make -o Makefile; make]
in the toplevel directory, with coqc and ocamlc in your path.

Then add the paths to your .coqrc:

Add ML Path "/Users/mat/research/coq/equations/src".
Add Rec LoadPath "/Users/mat/research/coq/equations/theories" as Equations.

Alternatively, to install it, type

   make install CMXSFILES0=src/equations_plugin.cmxs

in the toplevel directory.

As usual, you will need to run this command with the appropriate privileges
if the version of Coq you are using is installed system-wide, rather than
in your own directory. E.g. on Ubuntu, you would prefix the command with
"sudo" and then enter your user account password when prompted.

A preliminary documentation is available in doc/ and 
some examples in test-suite/.
